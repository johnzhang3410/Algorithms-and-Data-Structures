# Algorithms

Implementations of different data structures.
All projects are done through a text editor (Geany) and compiled using g++ under Windows command lines, tested in Linux environment.

Project 1: Doubly linked list class with sentinels, optimized code for clarity and runtime. Throughly tested with self-written tests.

Project 2: Resizable deque implemented with circular array 

Following are (will) be implemented using Java, in VSCode: 

[X]Array Class  
[]Linked List 
[]Stacks 
[]Queues 
[]Hash Tables 
[]Binary Trees 
[]AVL Trees 
[]Heaps 
[]Graphs 
[x]Linked List
[x]Priority Queue
