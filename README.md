# Algorithms

Projects that I worked on in my Algorithms and Data Structures Course. 
All projects are done through a text editor (Geany) and compiled using g++ under Windows command lines. All projects are tested under a Linux environment.

Project 1: Doubly linked list class with sentinels, optimized code for clarity and runtime. Throughly tested with self-written tests.

Project 2: Resizable deque implemented with circular array
